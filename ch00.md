# React base app
## Chapter 0
### Install packages

In the root folder run `npm install`

### Install tailwind
I have already installed and setup tailwindcss for you. (basically, I just followed [this guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app)).
Tailwindcss is a utility-first CSS framework. This means that it will expose classes such as `m-1`, `m-2`, `m-3`, etc. to add a margin, or `text-center` to center your text.
Have a look at https://tailwindcss.com/ for more examples. 

A big feature of tailwindcss is that these classes are fully customizable. Feel free to ask questions about it, but it is not really the main scope of this workshop.
Let's add some Ordina colors to the configuration, so that we will get classes with this color.

In `tailwind.config.js` (in the root directory), paste the following inside the `theme.extend` section: 
```
//jworks color
colors: {
  primary: {
      100: '#ebf8ff',
      200: '#bee3f8',
      300: '#E37C30',
      400: '#63b3ed',
      500: '#E7904B',
      600: '#3182ce',
      700: '#EAB285',
      800: '#2c5282',
      900: '#F7D1A7',
  },
}
```

Tailwindcss will use these variables to create utility classes.
It will for example create a class `bg-primary-500`, and this class will add a background-color in our defined primary color.
Or if you wanted the text to have this color you could use the class `text-primary-500`

### Give it a name and make it nice

The one time you need to change some stuff in your `public` directory will be now. Change the title in the `<title>` tag
 in `public/index.html` to whatever you like.

Also update `src/index.css` to improve our styling later on:
```
html, body, #root {
	width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
}
```

When we ran `create-react-app`, an `App` component was created for demonstration purposes.
We will still use the `App.tsx` file, but we can remove the following:

* `App.test.tsx`
* `App.css`

Change the content of  `App.tsx` to this:

```
import React from 'react';

export function App() {
  return (
    <div>Hello Jworks</div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

This is the most basic implementation of a react component. It consists of:

* An import of React lib (You have to do this for every react component)
* A function that returns some JSX (More about that later, spoiler alert, this is not “HTML”)

Now you also see why we love React, its simplicity, everything is just a function.
