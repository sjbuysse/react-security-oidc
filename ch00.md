### Install scss

`npm install node-sass —-save`

### Install tailwind

 [Setting Up Tailwind CSS In A React Project — Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/02/tailwindcss-react-project/)
 
 We'll use the tailwind library for creating css utility classes. 
 In short, this will provide you with a set of customizable classes that you can use throughout the application.
 This requires a little bit of setup. Feel free to ask questions about it, but it is not really the main scope of this workshop.

`npm add tailwindcss postcss-cli autoprefixer --save-dev`

We'll use the default tailwind configuration to create a set of UI classes, with the following command.

`npx tailwind init tailwind.js --full`

Since our css classes are customizable with variables (that we define in `tailwind.js`), our classes will have to be compiled 
before we can run the application. For this we use the postCSS library. 
We create a postCSS config file in the root folder.

`touch postcss.config.js`

with the following content

```
const tailwindcss = require(‘tailwindcss’);
module.exports = {
    plugins: [
        tailwindcss(‘./tailwind.js’),
        require(‘autoprefixer’)
    ],
};
```
What happens here is the following, you import the `tailwindcss` package with `require` and assign it to the `tailwindcss` variable.
Then we expose this package for postCSS & we also configure where the package can find our `tailwind.js` config file with all variables.
We also expose the `autoprefixer` library, so that postCSS can prefix the classes with the correct tags for the different browsers.

After that, we create 2 css files.  
1 we call `assets/tailwind.css` in which all the wanted tailwind css will be imported, this is the input that goes to postCSS.
1 we call `assets/tailwind.generated.css`. This file will contain the compiled css that postCSS generates. This is also 
the css file that we will use in our `index.tsx`, so that we can access the css in our app.
```
import '/assets/tailwind.generated.css'
```

Finally we edit our `package.json` so that the postCSS compilation will run during build and running of the application.
```
“scripts”: {
	...,
	“start”: “npm run watch:tailwind && react-scripts start”,
  	“build”: “npm run build:tailwind && react-scripts build”,
  	“build:tailwind”: “postcss src/assets/tailwind.css -o 	src/assets/tailwind.generated.css”,
	“watch:tailwind”: “postcss src/assets/tailwind.css -o src/assets/tailwind.generated.css”,
  ...
},
```

### Give it a name and make it nice

The one time you need to change some stuff in your `public` directory will be now. Change the title in the `<title>` tag
 in `public/index.html` to whatever you like.

Also update `src/index.css` to improve our styling later on:
```
html, body, #root {
	width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
}
```

When we ran `create-react-app`, a `App` component was created for demonstration purposes.
We will still use the `App.tsx` file, but we can remove the following:

* `App.test.tsx`
* `App.css`

Change the content of  `App.tsx` to this:

```
import React from 'react';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
        Hello Jworks
    </div>
  );
}
```

This is the most basic implementation of a react component. It consists of:

* An import of React lib (You have to do this for every react component)
* A function that returns some JSX (More about that later, spoiler alert, this is not “HTML”)

Now you also see why we love React, its simplicity, everything is just a function.

### Install react router

React is a library, not a full blown framework. This means some extra features like routing is free to choose by you. We will install `react-router` as it is the most used package in the react community.

```
npm install react-router-dom @types/react-router-dom --save
```

Wrap your app component with the `<BrowserRouter>` component that is provided by this library.
```
import { BrowserRouter } from ‘react-router-dom
...
<BrowserRouter>
  <App>
    ...
  </App>
</BrowserRouter>
```
