### Install tailwind

 [Setting Up Tailwind CSS In A React Project — Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/02/tailwindcss-react-project/)
 
 We'll use the tailwind library for creating css utility classes. 
 In short, this will provide you with a set of customizable classes that you can use throughout the application.
 This requires a little bit of setup. Feel free to ask questions about it, but it is not really the main scope of this workshop.

`npm install tailwindcss postcss-cli autoprefixer --save-dev`

We'll use the default tailwind configuration to create a set of UI classes, with the following command.

`npx tailwind init tailwind.js --full`

This creates a file `tailwind.js` with a lot of customizable css variables in it. 
We will already add a couple JWorks colors to it. Paste the following in the colors section: 
```
primary: {
    100: '#ebf8ff',
    200: '#bee3f8',
    //jworks color
    300: '#E37C30',
    400: '#63b3ed',
    //jworks color
    500: '#E7904B',
    600: '#3182ce',
    //jworks color
    700: '#EAB285',
    800: '#2c5282',
    //jworks color
    900: '#F7D1A7',
},
```

Using all of these variables, tailwindcss will create utility classes.
It will for example create a class `bg-primary-500`, and this class will add a background-color in our defined primary color.
To compile these classes we use the postCSS library. We create a postCSS config file in the root folder.

`touch postcss.config.js`

with the following content

```
const tailwindcss = require('tailwindcss');
module.exports = {
    plugins: [
        tailwindcss('./tailwind.js'),
        require('autoprefixer')
    ],
};
```
What happens here is the following, you import the `tailwindcss` package with `require` and assign it to the `tailwindcss` variable.
Then we expose this package for postCSS & we also configure where the package can find our `tailwind.js` config file with all variables.
We also expose the `autoprefixer` library, so that postCSS can prefix the classes with the correct tags for the different browsers.

After that, we create 2 css files.  
```
mkdir src/assets
touch src/assets/tailwind.css
touch src/assets/tailwind.generated.css
```
`src/assets/tailwind.css` is where all the wanted tailwind css will be imported, this is the input that goes to postCSS.
Let's import the base style and configurations in this file.
```
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```
`src/assets/tailwind.generated.css` will contain the compiled css that postCSS generates. This is also 
the css file that we will use in our `index.tsx`, so that we can access the css throughout our app.
```
import './assets/tailwind.generated.css';
```

Finally we edit our `package.json` so that the postCSS compilation will run during build and running of the application.
```
“scripts”: {
	...,
	"start": "npm run watch:tailwind && react-scripts start",
  	"build": "npm run build:tailwind && react-scripts build",
  	"build:tailwind": "postcss src/assets/tailwind.css -o src/assets/tailwind.generated.css",
	"watch:tailwind": "postcss src/assets/tailwind.css -o src/assets/tailwind.generated.css",
  ...
},
```

### Give it a name and make it nice

The one time you need to change some stuff in your `public` directory will be now. Change the title in the `<title>` tag
 in `public/index.html` to whatever you like.

Also update `src/index.css` to improve our styling later on:
```
html, body, #root {
	width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
}
```

When we ran `create-react-app`, a `App` component was created for demonstration purposes.
We will still use the `App.tsx` file, but we can remove the following:

* `App.test.tsx`
* `App.css`

Change the content of  `App.tsx` to this:

```
import React from 'react';

export function App() {
  return (
    <div>Hello Jworks</div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

This is the most basic implementation of a react component. It consists of:

* An import of React lib (You have to do this for every react component)
* A function that returns some JSX (More about that later, spoiler alert, this is not “HTML”)

Now you also see why we love React, its simplicity, everything is just a function.

### Install react router

React is a library, not a full blown framework. This means some extra features like routing is free to choose by you. We will install `react-router` as it is the most used package in the react community.

```
npm install react-router-dom @types/react-router-dom --save
```

Wrap your app component with the `<BrowserRouter>` component that is provided by this library.
```
import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom'
...
<BrowserRouter>
  <App>
    ...
  </App>
</BrowserRouter>
```
