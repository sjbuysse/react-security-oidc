## Create a small component lib

Let’s start by adding a simple header to our application. This will be our first component in our own component lib.
Later in this course, other components will be added.

`touch src/components/Header/Header.tsx`

And copy the following contents in that:

```
import React from "react";

interface Props {
  title: string;
  handleClickMenuButton: () => void;
}

export const Header = (props: Props) => {
  return (
    <nav className="flex items-center flex-wrap bg-primary-500 p-6">
      <button
        className="flex items-center px-3 py-2 border rounded text-teal-200 border-teal-400 hover:text-white hover:border-white"
        onClick={props.handleClickMenuButton}
      >
        <svg
          className="fill-current h-3 w-3"
          viewBox="0 0 20 20"
          xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
        >
          <title>Menu</title>
          <path d="M0 3h20v2H0V3zm0 6h20v2H0V9zm0 6h20v2H0v-2z" />
        </svg>
      </button>
      <h1 className="pl-3">{props.title}</h1>
    </nav>
  );
};
```

In `src/components` create a barrel file `touch src/components/index.ts` and add the following:

```
export * from "./Header/Header";
```

### What is going on here?

A component is just nothing else then a function. We call this a *`function component`*.
React also has class components, but it seems that the React team is moving away from this approach.
So we'll only use the function components, which are much nicer anyway. 
The function needs to return some `jsx`, which looks a bit like `HTML`.
Under the hood, React will compile JSX to React.createElement() calls which return plain JavaScript objects called “React elements”.

In JSX we use `{}` to indicate JavaScript expressions. In the `Header` component you can see that we do this for
example when we want to display the `title` variable. 

Like a normal function, these function components can receive arguments. When we use the component in a template,
we can pass it these arguments as attributes in its tag. So the `Header` would be used as following: 
```jsx harmony
<Header title="jworks base app" handleClickMenuButton={toggleSideNav} />
```
In React there is no equivalent to Angular's `@Output` EventEmitters, in stead we will pass a callback function to handle the events. 
So in this example we pass the `toggleSideNav` function that then can be executed from inside the `Header` component when the menu button is clicked.
