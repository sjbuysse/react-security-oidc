## Create a small component lib

Let’s start by adding a simple header to out application. This will be our first component in our own component lib. Later in this course, other components will be added.

`touch src/components/Header/Header.tsx`

And copy the following contents in that:

```
import React from "react";

interface Props {
  title: string;
  handleClickMenuButton: () => void;
}

export const Header = ({ title, handleClickMenuButton }: Props) => {
  return (
    <nav className="flex items-center flex-wrap bg-primary-500 p-6">
      <button
        className="flex items-center px-3 py-2 border rounded text-teal-200 border-teal-400 hover:text-white hover:border-white"
        onClick={handleClickMenuButton}
      >
        <svg
          className="fill-current h-3 w-3"
          viewBox="0 0 20 20"
          xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
        >
          <title>Menu</title>
          <path d="M0 3h20v2H0V3zm0 6h20v2H0V9zm0 6h20v2H0v-2z" />
        </svg>
      </button>
      <h1 className="pl-3">{title}</h1>
    </nav>
  );
};
```

In `src/components` create a barrel file `touch src/components/index.ts` and add the following:

```
export * from "./Header/Header";
```

### What is going on here?

    * A component is just nothing else then a function. We call this a *`functional component`*.
    * Functional components can have properties. The `title` is an input property and can be compered to the angular variant `@Input`. The `handleClickMenuButton` is an event and can be compared to angulars `@Output`.
    * Each component need to return some `jsx`. The `onClick` handler of the button will be passed by our `handleClickMenuButton` and the `title` is rendered with `{}` on the dom.
    * In the current verion of react, you don’t need classes anymore!
    * `jsx` isn’t html. It is an easy way provided by React to build UI's by using the html syntax. Writing a `<div/>` can also be written as `React.createElement(‘div’, ...)`. Which actualy happens to all jsx written in a React application.
