## Using state in your component

In this branch we've added a `Sidenav` component to the our components folder. 
This component uses an animation library called `React Spring`. To install this library run
```
npm install react-spring --save
```

For now, you don't have to know how this animation library works. 
Let's now focus on using these existing components. Add the following code to your `App.tsx`,
right under the `<Header />`. 
```jsx harmony
<SidenavContainer>
    <Sidenav isSidenavOpen={true}>
    {/* Here come the navitems */}
    </Sidenav>
    <SidenavContent>
    {/* Here comes the page content */}
    </SidenavContent>
</SidenavContainer>
```

Now as you can see the navigation will always be open, since we're always passing `true` to the `Sidenav` component.
Wouldn't it be better if we could keep some kind of state in our `App` component, to indicate if the sidenav should be open or not?
To add state to our component we will use a **hook**. Hooks are a react feature that allows us to use state and 
hook into the lifecycles of your component. 
```jsx harmony
import React, { useState } from "react";

export function App() {
    const [isSidenavOpen, setIsSidenavOpen] = useState(false);
    ...
```
When you call the `useState` hook, you can give an initial value (here we passed `false` as initial state).
This hook returns an array with the first element being the current state value, 
and the second element is a function to update this state. So if we for example want to update the state 
of `isSidenavOpen` to `true`, we would call `setIsSidenavOpen(true)`. 
By updating the state this way, React knows that it has been updated and that it should re-render.

Can you put the pieces together and open the `Sidenav` whenever our menubutton is clicked in the `Header`?

### The rules of hooks
1. Only call Hooks at the top level. Don’t call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions.
2. Only call Hooks from React function components. Don’t call Hooks from regular JavaScript functions. (There is just one other valid place to call Hooks — your own custom Hooks. We’ll learn about them in a moment.)
