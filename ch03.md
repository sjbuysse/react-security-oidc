## Routing with React Router

Below you'll find the most basic routing example, that I've copied from the [documentation](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start)
As we said before, in order to use the router, we have to wrap our app with the `BrowserRouter` component. 
Then to add a link you use the `Link` component, provided by the `react-router-dom` library.
Where you want to render the result of the route, you use the `Switch` component. It works a bit like 
Angular's `router-outlet`, and will render the matched route as its child. 

```jsx harmony
import React from "react";
import { BrowserRouter, Switch, Route, Link } from "react-router-dom";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <div>
        <nav>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <Link to="/">Home</Link>
            </li>
            <li>
              <Link to="/about">About</Link>
            </li>
            <li>
              <Link to="/users">Users</Link>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </nav>

        {/* A <Switch> looks through its children <Route>s and
            renders the first one that matches the current URL. */}
        <Switch>
          <Route path="/about">
            <About />
          </Route>
          <Route path="/users">
            <Users />
          </Route>
          <Route path="/">
            <Home />
          </Route>
        </Switch>
      </div>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}

function Home() {
  return <h2>Home</h2>;
}

function About() {
  return <h2>About</h2>;
}

function Users() {
  return <h2>Users</h2>;
}
```

Now can you use this information to add some links inside the `Sidenav`, and to render the matched route
inside the `SidenavContent`?
