# Chapter 4

In this chapter we will add a _clients_ feature to our app.
It's a good idea to split up your app up in smaller pieces.
In this app we will take the domain driven approach, and create a folder for each business domain.
We try to avoid that one business domain uses code from another business domain, shared components and other shared logic we lift 
to the `src/` folder.

## The clients feature

The clients feature is a CRUD UI (create, read, update & delete) where a list of client is shown. Following operations can be done:

- Creating a client
- Editing a client
- Deleting a client

The following chapters will guide you to build the clients feature.

### Folder structure

Let's create a new folder for our feature/domain called _clients_ `mkdir src/clients`.
Inside this folder we create the following folders and an _index.ts_ barrel file.
This is a file that will bundle everything of the clients feature that we would like to export. 
It sort of functions as a public API of our clients module.

- `mkdir src/clients/containers`
  Containers are sometimes called _smart components_. Most of the business logic is located in these components.
  They are responsible of keeping state and fetching data. 
- `mkdir src/clients/components`
  Will contain all (dumb) components that are feature related. they are more generic and re-usable than container components. 
  These components will get data input and callback functions from the containers. 
  Later on we will have for example a `ClientForm` component, which is a component that holds a form. This component
  will get all the data from a parent container, and it will also get a callback function to handle a form submission.
- `mkdir src/clients/pages`
  This folder will contain the some pages. As you'll see, a page is just a component where we manage the routing of the module.
- `mkdir src/clients/services`
  Services will be defined here. An example of a service is a collection of data fetching logic.
- `mkdir src/clients/models`
  Our models will be defined here. For example, we will have a `Clients` model.
- `touch src/clients/index.ts`
  This is a barrelfile exporting the things that are needed outside of our `Clients` module.
  Don't just put everything in here, this should be used as a public API and should be maintained that way (in our opinion).
  Perhaps the thing you want to export should not even live in the `Clients`, but rather be in the shared `src` level.

### Clients Page

1. Our clients module will export a `ClientsPage`, which then can be routed to in the `App` component.

`mkdir src/clients/pages/ClientsPage`
`touch src/clients/pages/ClientsPage/ClientsPage.tsx`

2. Do you remember how to make a component? Create and export a `ClientsPage` component, that simply displays a title that says 'Here comes the clients page'.
If you forgot how to make a component, then have a look the `Header` component that you created earlier.

3. Update the barrel file (`src/clients/index.ts`):
We will export this page, as this component is needed outside of our _Clients_ module.

```jsx harmony
export * from "./pages/ClientsPage/ClientsPage";
```

4. Remember how in `App.tsx` we were showing some filler text on the clients route `(Here comes the clients page)`?
We can now exchange this text for the actual `ClientsPage` component that you just created.
When you import the `ClientsPage` in `App.tsx`, make sure that you import it from the barrel file and not from the `ClientsPage` file. 

```jsx harmony
import { ClientsPage } from "./clients";
...
```

Our app wil now look exactly the same as before, with the big difference we introduced the clients domain and routed to a `ClientsPage`.
