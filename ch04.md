# Chapter 4

The solution of the previous chapter is implemented in this chapter. You should be able to navigate to the products page and the clients page.

All commands in this chapter start from the project root dir!

## The products feature

The products feature is a CRUD UI where a list of products is shown. Following operations can be done:

- Creating a product
- Editing a product
- Deleting a product

The follwing chapters will guide you to build the products feature.

### Folder structure

Let's create a new folder for our feature called _products_ `mkdir src/products`.
Inside this folder we create the following folders and an _index.ts_ barrel file.

- `mkdir src/products/containers`
  All components created in here are responsible of keeping state and fetchin data. Typically these are the components where the react router routes to
- `mkdir src/products/components`
  Will contain all components that are feature related. Later on we will have for example a `ProductForm`.
- `mkdir src/products/services`
  Services like for example to retrieve data will be defined here
- `mkdir src/products/types`
  Typescript types will be defined here. For example, we will have a `Product` type.
- `touch src/products/index.ts`
  This is a barrelfile exporting the container components as these are publicly available for other features or our `App.tsx` component.

### Products container

1. We will end this chapter by creating our products container component just displaying the "Here comes the products page" message:

`mkdir src/products/containers/ProductsPage`
`touch src/products/containers/ProductsPage/ProductsPage.tsx`

2. We will create a small container component. Put this code inside the newly created `ProductsPage` component (`src/products/containers/ProductPage/ProductPage.tsx`):

```jsx harmony
import React from "react";

export function ProductsPage() {
  return <h2>Here comes the products page</h2>;
}
```

3. Update the barrel file (`src/products/index.ts`):

```jsx harmony
export * from "./containers/ProductsPage/ProductsPage";
```

4. Wire up the router (`./src/App.tsx`):

```jsx harmony
import { ProductsPage } from "./products";
...
<Route path={Routes.PRODUCTS}>
  <ProductsPage />
</Route>
```

Our app wil now look exactly the same as before, with the big difference we introduced the products domain and our first small container component as our starting point.
