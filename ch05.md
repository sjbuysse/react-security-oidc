# Chapter 5

We added the solution of chapter 4 on this branch, and make sure to run `npm install` as we added some additional components to our component lib:
- `src/components/ActionButton`
- `src/components/ActionButtonMenu`
- `src/components/Page`
- `src/components/Table`

make sure you run `npm install` again as we used some features from the `ReachUI` library, this is a library that helps us with 
creating typical components (such as alerts, modals, buttons, etc.) in an accessible way, so that they work properly with 
screen readers and on mobile devices. For example we use their `menu-button` feature (https://reach.tech/menu-button) to create our new `ActionButtonMenu` component.

## Retrieve data from the server

Back in our app, if we navigate to the clients page, in the end we would like to have a table displaying all the clients we have.
First step then is to get some clients data from the server.

1. Create the Clients model by running `touch src/clients/model/Client.ts` and paste the following inside it:

```jsx harmony
export interface Client {
  id: string;
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  email: string;
  birthday: string;
  city: string;
  zip: string;
}
```

2. Like we explained in the previous chapter, we will bundle backend API calls in services.
So let's create a service file for our `clients` module. 
`touch src/clients/services/clients.ts`
React.js does not ship with a special feature to make backend calls.
This allows you to choose whatever technology you like to retrieve your data from the server.
In this chapter we will use the [Fetch API](_https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API_), which is a browser standard. 
We will not have to install anything, since `Fetch` comes built into all modern browsers.

In our newly created we will add the call to the server:

```jsx harmony
export async function getClients(): Promise<Client[]> {
  const response = await fetch("https://base-app-backend.herokuapp.com/clients");

  return response.json();
}
```

## ClientsTable container
Let's create a container component `ClientsTable`. This component will use our service to retrieve the clients data. 
Then it will pass this data to our `Table` component that was added to our component lib.
This `Table` component will render a table for our data, it adds an `Edit` and `Delete` button on each row,
when we click one of these buttons, they will call the callback function that we pass in as a `prop` and pass it the `id` of that row. 
We will use that later when we implement the editting and deleting of a `client`.

Paste the following in `src/clients/containers/ClientsTable/ClientsTable.tsx`:

```jsx harmony
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import { Client } from "../../model/Client";
import { getClients } from "../../services/clients";
import { Table, Page } from "../../../components";

export function ClientsTable() {
  const [clients, setClients] = useState<Client[] | undefined>(undefined);

  /* NEW */
  const retrieveClients = async () => {
    const result = await getClients();
    setClients(result);
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    retrieveClients();
  }, []);

  return (
    <Table
      headers={[ "Id", "Name" ]}
      data={clients}
      onEdit={(clientId) => {console.log(`in the future this ${clientId} might come in handy.`)}}
      onDelete={(clientId) => {console.log(`in the future this ${clientId} might come in handy.`)}}
    ></Table>
  );
}
```

### The useEffect hook

In the above snipet you see the usage of the `useEffect` hook. We already discussed the `useState` hook.
The `useEffect` allows you to perform side effects in your function components. 
It is a function that can run on component mount, on updates of certain props, and cleanup when the component unmounts.
The `useEffect` function takes 2 arguments.
The first argument is a callback function that performs the desired side effect.
This callback function can also return another callback that will be called when the component unmounts.
This way you can perform cleanup actions such as unsubscribing to avoid memory leaks. 
```
function FriendStatus(props) {
  // ...
  useEffect(() => {
    ChatAPI.subscribeToFriendStatus(props.friend.id, handleStatusChange);
    return () => {
      ChatAPI.unsubscribeFromFriendStatus(props.friend.id, handleStatusChange);
    };
  });
```

Setup like this, this effect will run every time the component re-renders, so basically every time any prop or state updates.
When we want to control when the effect runs, we use the second argument that the `useEffect` function takes.
This argument is an array with variables. This is a dependency array.
The `useEffect` hook will now only run when any of the variables in this array change and get a new reference. 
So the effect below will only run when the `count` prop changes.
```tsx
const CountComponent = (count: number, someOtherVariable: any) => {
    useEffect(() => {
      document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
    }, [count]); // Only re-run the effect if count changes
}
```
When we want to run the effect only once (on component mount), we pass an empty dependency array.
Since there are no variables in the dependency array, no changes can trigger it to run again.
This is exactly what we want on our `ClientsTable` effect, right?
Once the component is rendered, fetch the data, and set the state.

``` jsx harmony
useEffect(() => {
   retrieveClients();
}, []);
```

In short, I like to think about the `useEffect` hook as a way to run some synchronisation logic for when some props or 
state initializes, changes or gets destroyed.

More info about useEffect can be found [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html).

## Route to the table
The final thing we need to do is route to the `ClientsTable` container. Remember how we already have `Switch` component
in `App.tsx` that leads us to the `ClientsPage` when we route to `/clients`? 
Well, we will now add another `Switch` component to the ClientsPage, to match any subroutes of `/clients`.  

```tsx
export function ClientsPage() {
    const { url, path }: match = useRouteMatch();
    const { push } = useHistory();
    const gotToCreateClient = () => push(`${url}/create`);

    return (
        <Switch>
            <Route exact path={path}>
                <Page title="Clients" onCreateButtonClick={gotToCreateClient}>
                    <ClientsTable></ClientsTable>
                </Page>
            </Route>
            <Route path={`${path}/create`}>
                <Page title="Create client">
                    Here will come the CreateClient container
                </Page>
            </Route>
            <Route path={`${path}/:clientId/edit`}>
                <Page title="Edit client">
                    Here will come the EditClient container
                </Page>
            </Route>
        </Switch>
    );
}
```
Do you see the `useRouteMatch`? This is a custom hook that `react-router` provides. This hook will return a `match` object.
This `match` object has some useful properties that give information about the current url. 
* The `url` property holds a copy of the current url, simple as that. For example, the url could be `/clients/1234/edit` .
* The `path` property holds the current path, including the `path parameters`. For example it could be `/clients/:clientId/edit`

Can you see why it's important to use `url` when linking to a different location, and to use `path` when trying to match a route
in the `Switch` component?  

## Result

You should now see the clients in a table!
