# Chapter 5

We added the solution of chapter 4 on this branch, andMake sure to run `npm install` as we added some additional components to our component lib:
- `src/components/ActionButton`
- `src/components/ActionButtonMenu`
- `src/components/Page`
- `src/components/Table`

make sure you run `npm install` again as we added some features from the `ReachUI` library, this is a library that helps us with 
creating typical components (such as alerts, modals, buttons, etc.) in an accessible way, so that they work properly with 
screen readers and on mobile devices. For example we use their `menu-button` feature (https://reach.tech/menu-button) to create our new `ActionButtonMenu` component.

## Get the backend up & running

We created a small backend for you guys, which will be very easy to set up & run. 
Clone this repository into a new folder (outside of this project).
Go into the cloned foler and run `npm install` to install the `json-server` dependency.
You can start the mock backend service with the command `node backend.js`.

## Retrieve data from the server

Back in our app, if we navigate to the clients page, in the end we would like to have a table displaying all the clients we have.
First step then is to get some clients data from the server.

1. Create the Clients model by running `touch src/clients/types/client.ts` and paste the following inside it:

```jsx harmony
export interface Client {
  id: string;
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  email: string;
  birthday: string;
  city: string;
  zip: string;
}
```

2. Like we explained in the previous chapter, we will bundle backend API calls in services.
So let's create a service file for our `clients` module. 
`touch src/clients/services/clients.ts`
React.js does not ship with a special feature to make backend calls.
This allows you to choose whatever technology you like to retrieve your data from the server.
In this chapter we will use the [Fetch API](_https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API_), which is a browser standard. 
We will not have to install anything, since `Fetch` comes built into all modern browsers.

In our newly created we will add the call to the server:

```jsx harmony
export async function getClients(): Promise<Client[]> {
  const response = await fetch("http://localhost:8080/clients");

  return response.json();
}
```

## ClientsTable container
Let's create a container component `ClientsTable`. This component will use our service to retrieve the clients data. 
Then it will pass this data to our `Table` component that was added to our component lib.

Paste the following in `src/products/containers/ClientsTable/ClientsTable.tsx`:

```jsx harmony
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import { Client } from "../../types/Client";
import { getClients } from "../../services/clients";
import { Table, Page } from "../../../components";

export function ClientsTable() {
  const [clients, setClients] = useState<Client[] | undefined>(undefined);

  /* NEW */
  useEffect(async () => {
    const fetchedClients = await getClients();
    setClients(fetchedClients);
  }, []);

  return (
    <Page title="Products" onCreateButtonClick={() => {}}>
        <Table
          headers={[ "Id", "Name" ]}
          data={clients}
          onEdit={() => {}}
          onDelete={() => {}}
        ></Table>
    </Page>
  );
}
```

### The useEffect hook

In the above snipet you see the usage of the `useEffect` hook. We already discussed the `useState` hook.
The `useEffect` allows you to perform side effects in your function components. 
It is a function that can run on component mount, on updates of certain props, and cleanup when the component unmounts.
The `useEffect` function takes 2 arguments.
The first argument is a callback function that performs the desired side effect.
This callback function can also return another callback that will be called when the component unmounts.
This way you can perform cleanup actions such as unsubscribing to avoid memory leaks. 
```
function FriendStatus(props) {
  // ...
  useEffect(() => {
    ChatAPI.subscribeToFriendStatus(props.friend.id, handleStatusChange);
    return () => {
      ChatAPI.unsubscribeFromFriendStatus(props.friend.id, handleStatusChange);
    };
  });
```

Setup like this, this effect will run every time the component re-renders, so basically every time a props or state updates.
When we want to manage when the effect runs, we use the second argument that the `useEffect` function takes.
This argument is an array with variables. The `useEffect` hook will now only run when any of the variables in this array change and get a new reference. 
So the effect below will only run when the `count` prop changes.
```tsx
const CountComponent = (count: number, someOtherVariable: any) => {
    useEffect(() => {
      document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
    }, [count]); // Only re-run the effect if count changes
}
```
When we want to run the effect only once (on component mount), we pass an empty dependency array.
Since there are no variables in the dependency array, no changes can trigger it to run again.
This is exactly what we want on our `ClientsTable` effect, right?
Once the component is rendered, fetch the data, and set the state.

``` jsx harmony
useEffect(async () => {
    const fetchedClients = await getClients();
    setClients(fetchedClients);
}, []);
```

More info about useEffect can be found [here](_https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html_).

## Result

You should now see the clients in a table!
