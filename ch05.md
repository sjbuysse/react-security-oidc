# Chapter 5

<<<<<<< HEAD
We added the solution of chapter 4 on this branch, and make sure to run `npm install` as we added some additional components to our component lib:
=======
The solution of the previous chapter is implemented in this chapter. You should still be able to navigate to the products page and the clients page.

Make sure to run `npm install` as we added some additional background libraries for our small component lib. The component lib is expanded with the following components:

Also make sure that from this point the jworks demo backend app is running!

>>>>>>> Add solution to ch04
- `src/components/ActionButton`
- `src/components/ActionButtonMenu`
- `src/components/Page`
- `src/components/Table`

<<<<<<< HEAD
make sure you run `npm install` again as we used some features from the `ReachUI` library, this is a library that helps us with 
creating typical components (such as alerts, modals, buttons, etc.) in an accessible way, so that they work properly with 
screen readers and on mobile devices. For example we use their `menu-button` feature (https://reach.tech/menu-button) to create our new `ActionButtonMenu` component.

## Retrieve data from the server

Back in our app, if we navigate to the clients page, in the end we would like to have a table displaying all the clients we have.
First step then is to get some clients data from the server.

1. Create the Clients model by running `touch src/clients/models/Client.ts` and paste the following inside it:

```jsx harmony
export interface Client {
  id: string;
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  email: string;
  birthday: string;
  city: string;
  zip: string;
}
```

2. Like we explained in the previous chapter, we will bundle backend API calls in services.
So let's create a service file for our `clients` module. 
`touch src/clients/services/clients.ts`
React.js does not ship with a special feature to make backend calls.
This allows you to choose whatever technology you like to retrieve your data from the server.
In this chapter we will use the [Fetch API](_https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API_), which is a browser standard. 
We will not have to install anything, since `Fetch` comes built into all modern browsers.

In our newly created we will add the call to the server:

```jsx harmony
export async function getClients(): Promise<Client[]> {
  const response = await fetch("https://base-app-backend.herokuapp.com/clients");
=======
## Retrieve data from the server

If we navigate to the product page, in the end we would like to have a table displaying all the products we have. First step to do that is actually have some products by making a call to a server.
In Angular, this is done by the `HttpClient` module that ships with Angular by default. React.js does not ship with something like that by default. It is as previously mentioned a UI library and not a framework. This allows you to choose whatehever you like to retrieve your data from the server. In this chapter we will use [API](_https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API_).

In Angular we put something like this in a `Service`. We will kinda do the same for our products feature

1. Create the Product type by running `touch src/products/types/product.ts` and paste the following inside it:

```jsx harmony
export interface Product {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  productCode: string;
}
```

2. Create the service by running `touch src/products/services/products.ts` and export the following function:

```jsx harmony
export async function getProducts(): Promise<Product[]> {
  const response = await fetch("http://localhost:8080/products");
>>>>>>> Add solution to ch04

  return response.json();
}
```

<<<<<<< HEAD
## ClientsTable container
Let's create a container component `ClientsTable`. This component will use our service to retrieve the clients data. 
Then it will pass this data to our `Table` component that was added to our component lib.
This `Table` component will render a table for our data, it adds an `Edit` and `Delete` button on each row,
when we click one of these buttons, they will call the callback function that we pass in as a `prop` and pass it the `id` of that row. 
We will use that later when we implement the editting and deleting of a `client`.

Paste the following in `src/clients/containers/ClientsTable/ClientsTable.tsx`:

```jsx harmony
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import { Client } from "../../models/Client";
import { getClients } from "../../services/clients";
import { Table, Page } from "../../../components";

export function ClientsTable() {
  const [clients, setClients] = useState<Client[] | undefined>(undefined);

  /* NEW */
  const retrieveClients = async () => {
    const result = await getClients();
    setClients(result);
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    retrieveClients();
  }, []);

  return (
    <Table
      headers={[ "Id", "Name" ]}
      data={clients}
      onEdit={(clientId) => {console.log(`in the future this ${clientId} might come in handy.`)}}
      onDelete={(clientId) => {console.log(`in the future this ${clientId} might come in handy.`)}}
    ></Table>
=======
## Retrieve the products in the ProcuctPage container app

Paste the following in `src/products/containers/ProductsPage/ProductsPage.tsx`:

```jsx harmony
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import { Product } from "../../types/Product";
import { getProducts } from "../../services/products";
import { Table, Page } from "../../../components";

export function ProductsPage() {
  const [products, setProducts] = useState<Product[] | undefined>(undefined);
  const rehydrateProducts = async () => setProducts(await getProducts());

  /* NEW */
  useEffect(() => {
    rehydrateProducts();
  }, []);

  return (
    <Page title="Products" onCreateButtonClick={() => {}}>
      <Table
        headers={["Id", "Name", "Description", "Product Code"]}
        data={products}
        onEdit={() => {}}
        onDelete={() => {}}
      ></Table>
    </Page>
>>>>>>> Add solution to ch04
  );
}
```

### The useEffect hook

In the above snipet you see the usage of the `useEffect` hook. We already discussed the `useState` hook.
<<<<<<< HEAD
The `useEffect` allows you to perform side effects in your function components. 
It is a function that can run on component mount, on updates of certain props, and cleanup when the component unmounts.
The `useEffect` function takes 2 arguments.
The first argument is a callback function that performs the desired side effect.
This callback function can also return another callback that will be called when the component unmounts.
This way you can perform cleanup actions such as unsubscribing to avoid memory leaks. 
```
function FriendStatus(props) {
  // ...
  useEffect(() => {
    ChatAPI.subscribeToFriendStatus(props.friend.id, handleStatusChange);
    return () => {
      ChatAPI.unsubscribeFromFriendStatus(props.friend.id, handleStatusChange);
    };
  });
```

Setup like this, this effect will run every time the component re-renders, so basically every time any prop or state updates.
When we want to control when the effect runs, we use the second argument that the `useEffect` function takes.
This argument is an array with variables. This is a dependency array.
The `useEffect` hook will now only run when any of the variables in this array change and get a new reference. 
So the effect below will only run when the `count` prop changes.
```tsx
const CountComponent = (count: number, someOtherVariable: any) => {
    useEffect(() => {
      document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
    }, [count]); // Only re-run the effect if count changes
}
```
When we want to run the effect only once (on component mount), we pass an empty dependency array.
Since there are no variables in the dependency array, no changes can trigger it to run again.
This is exactly what we want on our `ClientsTable` effect, right?
Once the component is rendered, fetch the data, and set the state.

``` jsx harmony
useEffect(() => {
   retrieveClients();
}, []);
```

In short, I like to think about the `useEffect` hook as a way to run some synchronisation logic for when some props or 
state initializes, changes or gets destroyed.

More info about useEffect can be found [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html).

## Route to the table
The final thing we need to do is route to the `ClientsTable` container. Remember how we already have `Switch` component
in `App.tsx` that leads us to the `ClientsPage` when we route to `/clients`? 
Well, we will now add another `Switch` component to the ClientsPage, to match any subroutes of `/clients`.  

```tsx
export function ClientsPage() {
    const { url, path }: match = useRouteMatch();
    const { push } = useHistory();
    const gotToCreateClient = () => push(`${url}/create`);

    return (
        <Switch>
            <Route exact path={path}>
                <Page title="Clients" onCreateButtonClick={gotToCreateClient}>
                    <ClientsTable></ClientsTable>
                </Page>
            </Route>
            <Route path={`${path}/create`}>
                <Page title="Create client">
                    Here will come the CreateClient container
                </Page>
            </Route>
            <Route path={`${path}/:clientId/edit`}>
                <Page title="Edit client">
                    Here will come the EditClient container
                </Page>
            </Route>
        </Switch>
    );
}
```
Do you see the `useRouteMatch`? This is a custom hook that `react-router` provides. This hook will return a `match` object.
This `match` object holds information about the matched route to get to this component.
* The `url` property holds a copy of the url that belongs to this route, simple as that. For example, the url could be `/clients/1234/edit` .
* The `path` property holds the path that belongs to this route, including the `path parameters`. For example it could be `/clients/:clientId/edit`

Can you see why it's important to use `url` when linking to a different location, and to use `path` when trying to match a route
in the `Switch` component?  

## Result

You should now see the clients in a table!
=======
The useEffect hook can do bassicly the same thing that Angular does with it's lifecycling methods.
When retrieving data in an angular application, most likly this will take place in the `ngOnInit` lifecycle hook.

We can achieve the same result with the `useEffect` hook. The first argument is a function where you can do what you have to do, in our case we want to retrieve products. By default, the useEffect will trigger whenever the state or props change. If we do this:

```jsx harmony
useEffect(() => {
  rehydrateProducts();
});
```

We will cause an infinite loop, Everytime `rehydrateProducts` ran, we update the state, causing an other trigger to rerun. By default it acts like the angular `ngOnChanges` or react `componentDidUpdate` life cycle hook. That is not what we want, we want to run this one time. So how do we do this?

The second param is an empy array, this will prevent the useEffect hook to call every time the state or props changes and so it will act as the angular `ngOnInit` or the react`componentDidMount` life cycle methods. The array tells the useEffect hook when it specifivly need to rerender, as it is empty, it will not look out for any state changes. When no second param is given, by default, every change will be detected and the hook will run again.

More info about useEffect can be found [here](_https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html_).

## Result

You should see now a table with our products! And you discoverd that lifecycle methods are not needed at all in this chapter, how neat is that!
