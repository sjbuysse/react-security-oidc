# Chapter 6

We just learned how to do data fetching and work with the lifecycles of a component (using a `useEffect` hook).
We also already know how to route and create components. We're almost there for the basics! Let's create a form
so that we can create and edit any client.

## Create a client

The component lib is extended with some extra components to create the form (`FieldErrors`,`InputField`,`SubmitForm`,`TextAreaField`).
By the end of this chapter, it should be possible to create a product. What do we need to do?
- Add a new function in our service to create a client
- We will create the `ClientForm` component
- We will create a `CreateClient` container component where we will create a callback function that calls the `createClient` function
from our client service. We will than pass this callback down to the `ClientForm` component to handle the form submission.
- Route to this container component from in the `ClientPage`

### Update our clients.ts service

Add the following function to `src/clients/services/clients.ts`:

```tsx
export async function createClient(
  client: Partial<Client>
): Promise<Client[]> {
  const response = await fetch("http://localhost:8080/clients", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(client),
  });

  return response.json();
}
```

Notice how we post a `Partial<Contact>`. This is because our backend will add the `id` property, to complete the `Client` model.

### Forms (Controlled Components)

First of all, a little intro into forms in React. In HTML,form elements such as `<input>`, `<textarea>`,
and `<select>` typically maintain their own state and update it based on user input. 
Usually, we will want to maintain this state in our component itself, because this gives us much more power over validation, etc.
When we manage the form state in our component, we call this ato create a controlled component, we simply add the `value` and `onChange` attributes to our HTML form elements.
```jsx harmony
const EmailInput = () => {
    const [email, setEmail] = useState<string>('')

    return (
        <input type="text" value={email} onChange={(event) => setEmail(event.target.value)} />
    );
}
```

Let's say we want to add some validation to this we can easily implement that in the onChange method. 

```tsx
const EmailInput = () => {
    const [email, setEmail] = useState<string>('');
    const [validationError, setValidationError]  =  useState<string>('');
    
    handleChange = (event) => {
        const emailValue = event.target.value;
        if (!isValidEmail(email)) {
            setValidationError('this is not a valid email adress')
        }
        setEmail(emailValue);
    }

    return (
        <div>
            <input type="text" value={email} onChange={handleChange} />
            <span>{validationError}</span>
        </div>
    );
}

function isValidEmail(email) {
    const re = /^(([^<>()\[\]\\.,;:\s@"]+(\.[^<>()\[\]\\.,;:\s@"]+)*)|(".+"))@((\[[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\])|(([a-zA-Z\-0-9]+\.)+[a-zA-Z]{2,}))$/;
    return re.test(String(email).toLowerCase());
}
```

So this was 1 input field. Let me show you an example of how can deal with a complete form.
This is just one way to deal with forms, as you can see it really is just plain JS, so if you find 
that it's easier to manage your form in a different way, feel free to do so.

Notice below that our `onSubmit` callback expects a `Partial<Contact>`. This is because usually your models (here `Contact`)
will also have an `id` property. It could be that this `id` will be set in the backend or so, in any way, our form does not need
to deal with it, it's more a container component and/or backend thing. So we pass back a `Partial`.

```tsx
export interface FormField {
  value: string;
  errors: string[];
}

interface ContactFormFields {
    firstName: FormField;
    lastName: FormField;
    email: FormField;
}

interface Props {
    onSubmit: (formValue: Partial<Contact>) => void;
}

const ContactForm = (props: Props) => {
    const [formValue, setFormValue] = useState<ContactFormFields>({firstName: '', lastName: '', email: ''});
    const [validationError, setValidationError]  =  useState<string>('');
    
    // Validation
    const getValidationErrors = (key: string, value: string): string[] => {
        switch (key) {
          case 'firstName':
            return value.trim().length === 0 ? ["First name is required"] : [];
          case 'lastName':
            return value.trim().length === 0 ? ["Last name is required"] : [];
          default:
            return [];
        }
    };

    const isFormValid = Object.entries(formValue).reduce((amountOfErrors, [key, field]) =>
        amountOfErrors + getValidationErrors(key, field.value).length, 0) === 0;

    const handleChange = (event: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
        const key = event.target.name;
        const value = event.target.value;
        const errors = getValidationErrors(key, value);

        setFields({
          ...fields,
          [key]: {
            value,
            errors,
          },
        });
    };

    const handleOnSubmit = (event: React.FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) => {
        event.preventDefault();
        if (isFormValid) {
            props.onSubmit({
                firstName: formValue.firstName.value,
                lastName: formValue.lastName.value,
                email: formValue.email.value,
            });
        }
    };

    return (
        <form onSubmit={handleOnSubmit}>
            <input type="text" name="firstName" value={formValue.firstName.value} onChange={handleChange} />
            <input type="text" name="lastName" value={formValue.lastName.value} onChange={handleChange} />
            <input type="text" name="email" value={formValue.email.value} onChange={handleChange} />
            <button disabled={!isFormValid} type="submit">Save</button>
        </form>
    );
}
```

### ClientForm

Now that you know the basics of forms in React, you will make the ClientForm.

- `mkdir src/clients/components/ClientForm`
- `touch src/clients/components/ClientForm/ClientForm.tsx`

Your task is now: 
* Create a `ClientForm` component.
* Create an input field for all the properties of the `Client` model. If you want you can use the `InputField`
and `TextAreaField` components that we added to the components lib, but you can also choose to simply
 use HTML elements and you'll see what these other components do in the solution in the next chapter.
* Make sure that an `onSubmit` callback function comes in as a prop.
When clicking the submit button, it should call this function. You can also use the  `SubmitForm` component that is in 
our component lib.
* Also add an `onCancel` callback function as a prop.
When clicking a cancel button, it should call this function.
* Make `firstName` and `lastName` required fields.
* Disable the submit button when the form has a validation error.


### CreateClient container
After we created this form component we want to create a container component, that can call the client service to save
our new client from the form.
Remember to route to this component from the `ClientsPage`.

```tsx
export function CreateClient() {
  const { push } = useHistory();
  const goBackToClients = () => push("/clients");
  const onCreateClient = async (newClient: Partial<Client>) => {
    await createClient(newClient);
    goBackToClients();
  };

  return (
    <ClientForm
      onSubmit={onCreateClient}
      onCancel={goBackToClients}
    ></ClientForm>
  );
}
```
