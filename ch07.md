# Chapter 7

The solution of the previous chapter is implemented in this chapter.
When navigating to the clients page, you should see a list of clients in a table and the possibility to add client. Make sure that the jworks demo backend app is running!

## Edit a client

By the end of this chapter, it should be possible to edit a client. Following will be added:

- A new function in our service to edit a client
- We will create a `EditClient` container component where we will create a callback function that calls the `editClient` function
from our client service. We will than pass this callback down to the `ClientForm` component to handle the form submission.
- We will also expand our `ClientForm` component, so that it can receive a `Client` as a prop, to prefill the form.
- Add the nessescary routing and changes to our `ClientsPage` component

### Update our clients.ts service

Add the following function to `src/clients/services/clients.ts`:

```tsx
export const editClient = async (client: Client): Promise<Client[]> =>
  (
    await fetch(`${apiUrl}/${client.id}`, {
      method: "PUT",
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
      },
      body: JSON.stringify(client),
    })
  ).json();
```

Notice that here we don't send a `Partial` to the backend, this is because we're editing the `Client`,
so we already know the `id` and will be able to have a fill in all required properties of the `Client` model.

We will also need to be able to get the information of 1 client by its id, since our EditForm will need to get this data.
So let's create a service call for that too.

```tsx
export const getClient = async (id: string): Promise<Client> =>
  (await fetch(`${apiUrl}/${id}`)).json();
```

### Create the EditClient component

Create the component:

- `mkdir src/clients/containers/EditClient`
- `touch src/clients/containers/EditClient/EditClient.tsx`

In this container component we will need to: 
- Retrieve the client data from the server
- Pass the current data to the `ClientForm`, we will need to update this component so that it will prefill the form with this data.
- Create a function that calls the `createClient` function from our client service, when the form is submitted.
- Pass this callback function to our `ClientForm` component.

```tsx
export function EditClient() {
  const {
    params: { clientId },
  }: match<{ clientId: string }> = useRouteMatch();
  const { push } = useHistory();
  const [client, setClient] = useState<Client | undefined>(undefined);
  const goBackToClients = () => push("/clients");
  const retrieveClient = async () => {
    const client = await getClient(clientId);
    setClient(client);
  };
  const onEditClient = async (clientFields: Partial<Client>) => {
    await editClient({ ...client!, ...clientFields });
    goBackToClients();
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    retrieveClient();
    // eslint-disable-next-line
  }, []);

  return client ? (
    <ClientForm
      client={client}
      onSubmit={onEditClient}
      onCancel={goBackToClients}
    ></ClientForm>
  ) : null;
}

```

Do you see the `useRouteMatch`? We've used this custom hook before In chapter 5 to retrieve the current url and current path.
This hook will return a `match` object. As you can see the `match` object also contains information about the `params`, besides the `url` and the `path`. 
We will use this to find out which client we want to edit. As you'll see in a second, we will pass this param to the route in the `ClientPage`. 

You can see we will reuse our previous `ClientForm` component from ch06!

### Update the ClientForm

Since we want to prefill the form with the current `Client` data, we will need to accept a `Client` as a `prop` in our
`ClientForm` component. Then in our form we will have to update the state with this data.

I think that at this point this should be no problem for you, so give it a go!
* Change the initial state of our component so that our form gets prefilled.
* Make sure that this prop is optional in `ClientForm`, because we will still want to be able to open this component without
any existing client from the `CreatecClient` container.

### Route to our EditClient component

Again, I think you're up to speed to do this on your own, update the `ClientPage` accordingly.
