# Chapter 8

The solution of the previous chapter is implemented in this chapter.
When navigating to the clients page, you should see a list of clients in a table and the possibility to add and edit clients.
Make sure that the jworks demo backend app is running!

## Delete a client

By the end of this chapter, it should be possible to delete a client. Following will be added:

- A new function in our service to delete a product
- Implement the `onDelete` prop in the `ClientsTable` component.

### Update our clients.ts service

Add the following function to `src/clients/services/clients.ts`:

```tsx
export const deleteClient = async (id: string): Promise<any> => {
  return await fetch(`${apiUrl}/${id}`, {
    method: "DELETE",
  });
};
```

### Update our ClientsTable container

Now we need to call the `deleteClient` function when we click the `delete` button in a row in our table.
I think you can hook this up by now?
