# Chapter 9

The solution of the previous chapter is implemented in this chapter.
When navigating to the clients page, you should see a list of clients in a table and the possibility to add, edit and delete clients.
Make sure that the jworks demo backend app is running!

## Products feature

Now it's 100% up to you to make the `products` feature.
This feature is more or less the same as the `clients` one, but with the `products` model

```tsx
export interface Product {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  productCode: string;
}
```

Create a new `products` domain in your `src/` folder. Again, we'll want to be able to create products with a form.
We'll also want to display a table of these created products, and we want to be able to edit and delete these products.

One more thing that you'll need to know is that we have a working `products` endpoint on the backend. So you can use this for your CRUD calls.
```
https://base-app-backend.herokuapp.com/products
```

Go through the chapters and through the `client` feature when you get stuck. Once you're done, or if you really get stuck,
you can check chapter 10 for our solution.
