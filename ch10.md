As a bonus exercise, try to display the `CreateProduct` and `EditProduct` components in a modal.
For this, we'll use the ReachUI `Dialog` component
```
npm install @reach/dialog --save
```
Check out the [Reach Dialog documentation](https://reach.tech/dialog).
As you can see, the easiest solution would be to create a state in the `ProductsPage` component to indicate if the modal is open or closed. 
and wrap both the `CreateProduct` component and the `EditProduct` component in a ReachUI `Dialog` component.

Something more or less like this: 
```tsx
export function ProductsPage() {
    const {url}: match = useRouteMatch();
    const {push} = useHistory();
    const [showCreateDialog, setShowCreateDialog] = useState<boolean>(false);
    const [showEditDialog, setShowEditDialog] = useState<boolean>(false);

    const gotToCreateProduct = () => push(`${url}/create`);

    return (
        <>
            <Page title="Products" onCreateButtonClick={gotToCreateProduct}
                  openCreateDialog={() => setShowCreateDialog(true)}>
                <ProductsTable openEditDialog={() => setShowEditDialog(true)}></ProductsTable>
            </Page>
            <Dialog isOpen={showCreateDialog} onDismiss={() => setShowCreateDialog(false)}>
                <CreateProduct></CreateProduct>
            </Dialog>
            <Dialog isOpen={showEditDialog} onDismiss={() => setShowEditDialog(false)}>
                <EditProduct></EditProduct>
            </Dialog>
        </>
    );
}
```

This would work fine, but let's take it one step further and make sure that our Edit & Create components are still routable.
The trick is to use a child `Switch` component in our `ProductsPage`. 
In our `App` component we defined that the `ProductsPage` component should be rendered for every route that starts with a `/products/...`. 
```tsx
<Switch>
    <Route path={Routes.PRODUCTS}> <ProductsPage/> </Route>
    ...
</Switch>
```
We are going to add a new `Switch` component inside the `ProductPage` to match any subroutes of this `/products` path.
```tsx
export function ProductsPage() {
    const {url}: match = useRouteMatch();
    const {push} = useHistory();

    const gotToCreateProduct = () => push(`${url}/create`);

    return (
        <>
            <Page title="Products" onCreateButtonClick={gotToCreateProduct}>
                <ProductsTable></ProductsTable>
            </Page>
            <Switch>
                <Route path={`${url}/create`}>
                    <Dialog show={true} title={'Create product'}
                            onClose={() => push(url)}><CreateProduct></CreateProduct></Dialog>
                </Route>
                <Route path={`${url}/:productId/edit`}>
                    <Dialog show={true} title={'Edit product'}
                            onClose={() => push(url)}><EditProduct></EditProduct></Dialog>
                </Route>
            </Switch>
        </>
    );
}
```
Now, when you route for example to `products/create`, first the `products/` route will be matched in `App`, this will render the `ProductsPage`,
then inside `ProductsPage` it will also render the subroute `products/create` and it will ALSO render the `Dialog` with a `CreateProduct` component.
So both routes will be rendered at the same time. This results in a modal of `CreateProduct` with a background of `ProductsTable`.

To close the modals, we just want to route back to `products/`, so that the modal routes are not matched anymore.
Notice how the `url` property on the `match` object from `useRouteMatch()` equals `products/` because the route that is matched to get to
the `ProductsPage` component. If we would call this hook from inside the `CreateProduct` component, the url of the matched route would be `products/create`.

## re-fetch data on history change
Cool, right? Well, actually we now introduced a subtle bug in the code!
If you edit a product, and save it, you will return to the `products/` path.
But since this route was already matched in the first `Switch` in `App` component, it will not re-render, and so the data will be stale!
To fix this, we can subscribe to any changes on the `history` object in the `ProductsTable`,
and re-fetch the data when the location changes.

```tsx
const history = useHistory();
useEffect(() => {
    return history.listen(() => retrieveProducts())
},[history]);
```
