# Chapter 11

In this chapter we will add the option to make our app read-only.
When our app is read-only, we have to make sure that no product or client can be edited/created/deleted.
This is a great example of a use case for a store, since you will need this piece of state throughout your whole application.

For completeness: There is another way to share this global state in a clean way (it's called the `Context` API, and in fact redux uses this API too under the hood), 
but we are here to learn about redux.
[More info about the Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html)

## Install the redux library & redux-toolkit
```
npm install --save react-redux @types/react-redux
npm install --save @reduxjs/toolkit
```

## Store setup
### Folder structure

We will add a store to our root level of the app, but you could also add some feature stores to your different domains
in the future.

- `mkdir src/state/`
  Here we will add everything related to our global state
- `touch src/state/actions.ts`
  In this file we will add all the different actions (events) that eventually will result in state changes.
- `touch src/state/reducer.ts`
  In this file we will add the reducer function that takes the current state and an action as arguments. 
  It will match the action using a switch/case statement & return a new state accordingly.
  Remember, this is a pure function and should return a NEW state object.
  
  We will also define the `State` interface in this file and define an initial state that we can pass to the reducer
  as a default argument.
- `touch src/state/selectors.ts`
  In this file we will bundle functions that extract the data from the state. These functions we will pass to the
  `useSelector` hooks in our components.

### Actions
We will have one action, to toggle the read-only option

```js
import { createAction } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

export const toggleReadOnly = createAction('header/read-only button toggled');
```

### Reducer
In our reducer we will make sure this action is matched in a switch/case statement and we will return a new
state accordingly.

```tsx
import { toggleReadOnly } from './actions';

export interface State {
    isReadOnly: boolean;
}

const initialState: State = {
    isReadOnly: true
}

export function appReducer(state = initialState, action: any) {
    switch (action.type) {
        case toggleReadOnly.type:
        case sideNavToggle.type:
            return {...state, isReadOnly: !state.isReadOnly}
        default:
            return state
    }
}
```    

### Hook up our store to the app
Wrap the app with a `Provider` component to provide our store with its reducer.

```tsx
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
import {Provider} from 'react-redux';

const store = configureStore({
    reducer: {
        app: appReducer
    }
})
ReactDOM.render(
    <React.StrictMode>
        <BrowserRouter>
            <Provider store={store}>
                <App/>
            </Provider>
        </BrowserRouter>
    </React.StrictMode>,
    document.getElementById('root')
);
```

### Selectors
Here we create the functions to extract our `isReadOnly` option from the state. 
We will also use the `createSelector` function from redux-toolkit. 
This function memoizes our selection, this means that our selector will only trigger when the `isReadOnly` option really
changes in our state. 

If we would have more properties in our state, and one of them would change (but the `isReadOnly` value stays the same),
then `selectIsReadOnly` would not be triggered. This will avoid unnecessary renders of any component that uses this selector.

```js
import { State } from './reducer';
import { createSelector } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

const getAppState = (state: any) => state['app'];

export const selectIsReadOnly = createSelector(getAppState, (appState: State) => appState.isReadOnly);
```

Now your redux store is all setup to be used!

## Display the `isReadOnly` state in our `Header`.
I have added a new component for you, the `Lock` component. You can find it in `src/components/Icons/Lock.tsx`.
Add this component somewher into the `Header` component. You have to provide an `isOpen` attribute to this component. 
We will set this to false when the application is read-only and vice versa. 
Remember, you select a piece of state with the `useSelector` hook
```
const Header = () => {
    const isReadOnly = useSelector(selectIsReadOnly)
...
}
```

## Toggle the `isReadOnly` property in our state

The next challenge I have for you is to dispatch the `toggleReadOnly` action when a user clicks on the lock icon.
Remember, to access the `dispatch` function, we use the `useDispatch` hook.
If you did this correctly, the state should change & the lock should open or close depending on the state.
```
const Header = () => {
    const dispatch = useDispatch()
    const handleClickOnLock = () => dispatch(toggleReadOnly())
...
}
```

If something goes wrong use [Redux devtools](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension), to debug and 
double check if your action was successfully dispatched and updated the state. 

## Don't render "write" buttons and pages when the app is read-only

Now we will use this state throughout our app to avoid create/edit/delete actions being used.
use the `useSelector` in your container components (not in your dumb components!), and hide buttons where needed. 
For example in the `ClientsPage` you could not pass a `onCreateButtonClick` to the `Page` component, so that it will not render 
a `Add` button.
```
const isReadOnly = useSelector(selectIsReadOnly);

return <Page title="Clients" onCreateButtonClick={isReadOnly ? undefined : gotToCreateClient}>
    <ClientsTable></ClientsTable>
</Page>
```

We'll have to adjust the `Table` component so that we can let it know whether it should be readonly or not.
When it's readonly, the action buttons should be disabled in the `Table` component.
So start with adding a `isReadOnly` prop to the `Table`, that will be passed down from the container components.
```
interface TableRowProps<T> {
  item: T;
  isReadOnly: boolean;
  onEdit: (id: string) => void;
  onDelete: (id: string) => void;
}
```
In our `Table` we can now pass this prop down to the `isDisabled` prop of the `ActionButtonMenu` component that is being rendered.
```
<ActionButtonMenu disabled={isReadOnly}>
```

As a last thing, you should also block routing to the edit & create pages, this can be done by conditionally rendering the `<Route>`.
For example your `Switch` could look like this:
```
<Switch>
    <Route exact path={path}>
        <Page title="Clients" onCreateButtonClick={isReadOnly ? undefined : gotToCreateClient}>
            <ClientsTable></ClientsTable>
        </Page>
    </Route>
    {isReadOnly
        ? <span>The read-only setting is activated</span>
        : <>
            <Route path={`${path}/create`}>
                <Page title="Create client">
                    <CreateClient></CreateClient>
                </Page>
            </Route>
            <Route path={`${path}/:clientId/edit`}>
                <Page title="Edit client">
                    <EditClient></EditClient>
                </Page>
            </Route>
        </>
    }
</Switch>
```
