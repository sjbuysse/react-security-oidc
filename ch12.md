## Render props

In the last exercise we selected the `isReadOnly` state in our container components, and passed it down, through the Table component,
to the `ActionButtonMenu`. In fact the `Table` component did not need to know if it was readonly or not, all it did was passing down that prop.
This is called *prop drilling*, and is an annoying practice that comes as a side effect of only using redux selectors in your container components.

There is a pattern that solves this in an elegant way though, welcome to [render props](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html)!

A component with a render prop takes a function that returns a React element and calls it instead of implementing its own render logic.
An example might clarify last sentence.
```tsx
interface Props {
  user: User;
  renderAvatar: (user: User) => React.ReactNode;
}
const UserCard = (props: Props) => (
    <div className='p-4 rounded bg-white'>
       <div>props.renderAvatar(props.user)</div>
       <ul>
            <li>name: {props.user.name}</li>
            <li>age: {props.user.age}</li>
            <li>sex: {props.user.sex}</li>
       </ul>
    </div>
)

const UserListContainer = () => {
    const users = useSelector(selectUsers);
    return (<div>
       {users.map(user => <UserCard user={user}
                                    renderAvatar={() => <Avatar href={user.avatarUrl}/>}
                          />)} 
    </div>)
}

const Avatar = (props: {href: string}) => (
    <div className='border-2 border-primary-300'>
        <img src={user.href} />
    </div>
)
```

So instead of defining how to render the avatar in our `UserCard`, we allow the user to define how the avatar should be rendered by
passing a function that returns a React component (which renders the avatar).
In the example above we pass a function that returns the `Avatar` component. 
The result is that the `UserCard` is more generic now, and if someone wants to render the avatar in a different way, he can still
use the `UserCard` component.

Remember how nested components are accessible through the `children` prop in the parent?
That fact combined with the fact that components are just functions, we could just pass the render prop function by  
Well some people use this feature when using the render props pattern. The previous example would look now like this:

```tsx
interface Props {
  user: User;
  children: (user: User) => React.ReactNode;
}
const UserCard = (props: Props) => (
    <div className='p-4 rounded bg-white'>
       <div>props.renderAvatar(props.user)</div>
       <ul>
            <li>name: {props.user.name}</li>
            <li>age: {props.user.age}</li>
            <li>sex: {props.user.sex}</li>
       </ul>
    </div>
)

const UserListContainer = () => {
    const users = useSelector(selectUsers);
    return (<div>
       {users.map(user => <UserCard user={user}
                                    renderAvatar={() => <Avatar href={user.avatarUrl}/>}
                          />)} 
    </div>)
}

const Avatar = (props: {href: string}) => (
    <div className='border-2 border-primary-300'>
        <img src={user.href} />
    </div>
)
```

In our solution we applied this pattern to the `Table` component so that it becomes more generic and reusable.
